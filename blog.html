			<h2>Smart Squash</h2>
			<h3>January 15, 2015</h3>
			<img src="img/img-011515.jpg">
			<p>From <a href="http://www.brettsquashblog.com">Brett's Squash Blog</a>. Brett is so knowdlegeable in squash, that everytime he posts something on his blog I'll try to post it here with his permission.</p>
			<p>"For whatever reason, aside from a few great autobiographies and instructional-type books, there do not seem to be that many good reads about the game of squash out there.  Certainly not relative to other more mainstream sports.  Hopefully this will change in future as squash grows in popularity.</p>
			<p>There are notable exceptions to this, however, like two great books about squash written by Jim Zug.  Another is a book called 'Smart Squash' written by a gentleman named Austin Francis, which was first published 20 years ago, at the time that the US switched from hardball singles to the international softball game.  Austin interviewed all of the top US-based players and coaches at that time in order to understand what the critical differences are between hardball and softball.  Some of the names of those interviewed for advice are in the preface below.</p>
			<p>Austin's book presents the findings of his research in great detail and in a way that is easy to understand.  I read the book and remember thinking what a great resource it could be not only for those new to the game, but also to the myriad of young players who have all grown up playing softball and are now interested in playing hardball doubles too.  Although this book was written to help players switch from hardball to softball, it applies equally as well in the reverse. It has certainly helped me in the transition.</p>
			<p>So, when Austin approached me to write the preface to his newly published version of 'Smart Squash', I was honored to do that.  I only hope that my preface, which is copied below, does his book justice."</p>

			<h2>Jansher's comeback stalls in London</h2>
			<h3>January 1, 2015</h3>

			<p>Former World champion, Jansher Khan has once again decided to make a come back in international squash as there was no Pakistan in sight in World top 20 ranking.<br>“I feel that still there is enough squash left in me and I can surely make a come back knowing the hard fact squash is a game which requires top fitness and extra ordinary stamina to compete “, he told APP during his visit to Lahore Bureau here on Thursday.<br>38-year-Peshawar-born Jansher who holds the unique distinction of winning the world open for 8 times and British Open for 6 times, said he would enter the courts by taking part PSA London Squash Free Aged Open commencing from October 11 at Cumberland in North London.<br>He said, he has officially received an invitation from the organiser of the London Open to take part in the grand tournament and he has confirmed his participation.<br>“I have been given the honour to enter the tournament through a wild card in the main draw and not to participate in the qualifying round and I am thankful to the organisers for honouring me”, he said.<br>“I am not super fit at the moment but with seven weeks strenuous training I will be in that prime form which is needed for competing in international squash.</p>
			<p>Jansher’s unbeaten run in the world of squash was halted by Peter Nicol in the final of British Open in 1998 and then another loss at the hands of Jonathan Power in Dutch Open in July 1998 led the champion to announce his retirement.Jahangir maintained a stranglehold on the British Open up to 1991 (he won the championship 10 consecutive times), but when he finally relinquished the title it was Jansher who claimed it for the next six successive years.Jansher officially announced his retirement from squash in 2001. He won a total of 99 professional titles and was ranked the World No. 1 for over six years.<br>In the meantime he underwent surgery at home for his knees but the champion failed to recover and his come back in 2003 ended in failure as he could not stay in the courts for long time during his first match in Hong Kong Open.<br>“It is very frustrating that no Pakistani is among top 20 ranking for the past one decade after my retirement and there was a time when a few players were always in that ranking “,he said adding ” the young players have no habit of putting in hard work, following discipline and to pay attention to physical fitness and due to that they have failed to make their mark in international ranking.<br>“I know the task is uphill rather making impossible possible but I have a greater determination and will prove that I am still a player of better breed”, he asserted.<br>Former Champion claimed he is involved in active squash and was regularly taking part in exhibition or invitational tournaments abroad and is maintaining a good shape.Jansher said he is confident to win the tournament and said a victory will inspire him to keep playing squash for another three to four years.<br>“There are few examples that some top players including Hashim Khan and Ross Norman kept playing even in their 40′s and won the titles and hopefully I can also do so “,he said.</p>
